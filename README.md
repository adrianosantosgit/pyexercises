4 key principles of Object Oriented Programming are:
encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism

In this repo I plan to show some examples of each of them

A great article that explain this 4 principles can be found at:

  Encapsulation is achieved when each object keeps its state private, inside a class. Other objects don’t have direct access to this state. Instead, they can only call a list of public functions — called methods.
  Applying abstraction means that each object should only expose a high-level mechanism for using it. Think — a coffee machine. It does a lot of stuff and makes quirky noises under the hood. But all you have to do is put in coffee and press a button.
  Inheritance. It means that you create a (child) class by deriving from another (parent) class. This way, we form a hierarchy. The child class reuses all fields and methods of the parent class (common part) and can implement its own (unique part).
  Polymorphism gives a way to use a class exactly like its parent so there’s no confusion with mixing types. But each child class keeps its own methods as they are. Inheriting the parent Figure Interface lets you create a list of mixed triangles, circles, and rectangles. And treat them like the same type of object. Then, if this list attempts to calculate the surface for an element, the correct method is found and executed.

Order of origin 
Parentheses ()
Exponentiation **
Priority Operands *   /   //   %
Last Operations +   -
